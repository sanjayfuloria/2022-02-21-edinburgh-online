  <h3>Noteable service</h3>
  <p>
    For this workshop, we will be using the University of Edinburgh Noteable service.
    To prepare, please set up your notebook area as follows:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        In your browser, go to the
        <a href="https://noteable.edina.ac.uk/login">University of Edinburgh Noteable</a>
        login page and use your EASE credentials to access the site.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        When prompted to select a personal notebook server, choose
        &lsquo;Standard Notebook (Python 3)&rsquo; and select &lsquo;Start&rsquo;.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You should see a Jupyter Notebook screen.
        Using the &lsquo;Upload&rsquo; button on the top right,
        upload your downloaded copies of shell-lesson-data.zip and python-novice-gapminder-data.zip.
        You will need to select another &lsquo;Upload&rsquo; button in the directory listing each time.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
         Select the &lsquo;New&rsquo; dropdown menu at the top right and choose &lsquo;Terminal&rsquo;.
      </p>
      <p class="text-center">
        <img alt="Screenshot of Noteable root folder, with the &lsquo;New&rsquo; button selected and the options &lsquo;Python 3&rsquo;, &lsquo;Text File&rsquo;, &lsquo;Folder&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Terminal&rsquo; showing."
        src="./assets/img/noteable-new.png" class="img-thumbnail"/>
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>In the new tab that opens, you should see a black Terminal window.
      Enter the following text, one line at a time.</p>
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir -p Desktop/python-lesson
unzip shell-lesson-data.zip -d Desktop
unzip python-novice-gapminder-data.zip -d Desktop/python-lesson
exit</code></pre></div></div>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        You can now close the Terminal tab.
        In your original tab, you should see your new <strong>Desktop</strong> folder;
        if you select the name to enter it, you should see your <strong>shell-lesson-data</strong> and <strong>python-lesson</strong> folders.
        Back in your root folder, you can select and delete the zip files if you like, by ticking the boxes next to them and selecting the red dustbin icon above.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
